Material Design is a design language developed by Google that combines classic principles of good design with innovation and technology. This theme incorporates Material Design 3 principles to create a clean, modern aesthetic.

## Color System

Material Design uses a systematic approach to color. Instead of hard-coding colors, we use CSS custom properties that can be easily customized:

```css
:root {
  --primary: #000000;
  --surface: #ffffff;
  --on-surface: #1c1b1f;
}
```

## Elevation and Depth

While this theme keeps things minimal, Material Design's elevation system creates hierarchy through subtle shadows and layering.

## Typography Scale

Material Design defines a type scale that creates visual hierarchy. This theme uses two carefully chosen typefaces:

- **UnifrakturCook** for headings (distinctive, elegant)
- **Inter** for body text (clear, readable)

## Responsive Design

Material Design emphasizes responsive layouts that adapt to different screen sizes. This theme uses breakpoints to ensure great readability on all devices.

By following these principles, you can create interfaces that are both beautiful and functional.
