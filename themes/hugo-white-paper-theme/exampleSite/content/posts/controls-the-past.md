Hugo is one of the fastest static site generators available. It's built with Go and can build large sites in seconds, making it perfect for blogs, portfolios, documentation, and more.

## Why Static Sites?

Static sites offer several advantages:

- **Performance**: No database queries or server-side processing
- **Security**: Fewer attack vectors with no backend
- **Simplicity**: Easy to host and deploy
- **Version Control**: Your entire site in Git

## Hugo's Strengths

Hugo excels at:

1. **Speed**: Lightning-fast build times even for thousands of pages
2. **Flexibility**: Powerful templating with Go templates
3. **Content Management**: Organized content with front matter and taxonomies
4. **Themes**: Rich ecosystem of themes (like this one!)

## Getting Started

Creating a new Hugo site is simple:

```bash
hugo new site mysite
cd mysite
git clone https://github.com/nthnbch/hugo-white-paper-theme themes/hugo-white-paper
echo "theme = 'hugo-white-paper'" >> config.toml
hugo server
```

## Content Organization

Hugo uses a logical content structure:

- `content/posts/` for blog posts
- `content/pages/` for static pages
- Front matter for metadata

This structure makes it easy to organize and maintain your content as your site grows.
