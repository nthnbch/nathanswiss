Typography is more than just choosing fontsâ€”it's about creating hierarchy, rhythm, and personality in your content. In modern web design, typography plays a crucial role in user experience and brand identity.

## The Power of Font Selection

Choosing the right typeface sets the tone for your entire design. Serif fonts like Fraktur can evoke tradition and elegance, while sans-serif fonts like Inter provide clarity and modernity.

## Creating Visual Hierarchy

Good typography guides readers through your content naturally. Use size, weight, and spacing to create clear distinctions between headings, body text, and captions.

### Key Principles

- **Contrast**: Make important elements stand out
- **Consistency**: Use a limited type scale
- **Spacing**: Give your text room to breathe
- **Readability**: Always prioritize legibility

Typography is a powerful tool for designers. Master it, and you'll create more engaging, effective designs.
