## Zen Browser Takes a Major Leap Forward with Folders

When I [switched from Arc to Zen Browser](/posts/zen) earlier this year, I was impressed by its clean interface, Firefox foundation, and focus on privacy. However, there was one feature I missed from Arc: tab folders. This organizational tool was a game-changer for my workflow, allowing me to group related tabs together and reduce the visual clutter that comes with having dozens of tabs open.

I'm thrilled to report that the wait is finally over. Zen Browser has just announced the introduction of tab folders in their latest Twilight (beta) release, with the feature expected to arrive in the stable version with Firefox 142 later this month.

### What Are Zen Folders?

Zen Folders represent a significant evolution in how users can organize their browsing experience. Similar to the concept in Arc, folders in Zen allow you to group related tabs together, creating a more structured and less cluttered interface.

Based on my testing of the Twilight version, here's what makes Zen's implementation special:

1. **Workspace Integration**: Unlike Arc's approach, Zen Folders are deeply integrated with the existing workspace system. You can have different sets of folders for each workspace, maintaining the contextual separation that makes Zen so productivity-focused.

2. **Drag-and-Drop Creation**: Creating a folder is intuitive—simply drag one tab over another to automatically generate a folder. This feels more natural than Arc's somewhat cumbersome folder creation process.

3. **Visual Distinction**: Folders are visually distinct with subtle animations and color coding that can automatically match your workspace theme or be customized independently.

4. **Performance Focus**: Zen's implementation seems to use less memory than Arc's, with inactive folders being more aggressively unloaded to preserve system resources.

### Beyond Folders: What Else Is New?

While folders are certainly the headline feature, the latest updates to Zen Browser bring several other notable improvements:

#### Enhanced Split View

The split view feature, which allows you to view two tabs side by side, has received significant enhancements. You can now create complex layouts with multiple splits, and the tabs maintain their split configuration even after a browser restart.

#### Media Player Controller

The integrated media controller has been improved with a minimalist design that appears when media is playing in any tab. It offers quick controls for play/pause, skip, and volume, along with a thumbnail preview of the content—all without disrupting your browsing experience.

#### Performance Improvements

The Zen team continues to focus on performance optimization. The latest updates include:

- Faster window opening times
- Improved gradient rendering with reduced dithering artifacts
- Enhanced tab unloading mechanism for better memory management
- Backend improvements for mods (Zen's extension system) resulting in better performance and stability

#### Firefox 141 Foundation

Zen is now built on Firefox 141.0.3, inheriting all the security fixes and performance improvements from Mozilla's latest stable release. This ensures you're always protected against the latest threats while benefiting from cutting-edge web technologies.

## Looking Forward: The Zen Roadmap

According to the release notes and GitHub discussions, the Zen Browser team has an ambitious roadmap for the coming months:

1. **Zen Library**: A new feature that seems to be in development, though details are still scarce. Based on community speculation, it might be a knowledge management system integrated directly into the browser.

2. **Improved Settings Panel**: A complete overhaul of the settings interface is planned, which will consolidate all Zen-specific features into a more intuitive and accessible panel.

3. **Custom Workspace Management UI**: A new interface for managing workspaces is in development, promising to make workspace creation and switching even more intuitive.

## My Experience So Far

Having used Zen Browser exclusively for the past seven months, I've found it to be a worthy successor to Arc. The Firefox foundation provides rock-solid stability and compatibility with websites, while the Zen-specific features enhance productivity without feeling overwhelming.

The addition of folders is the final piece that was missing from my ideal browsing experience. During my testing of the Twilight version, I've found the implementation to be intuitive and reliable. The folders feel like a natural extension of Zen's philosophy: enhancing productivity through thoughtful design rather than feature bloat.

One particularly impressive aspect is how well folders integrate with existing features like workspaces and split views. I can now have a "Research" folder within my "Work" workspace, containing multiple split-view configurations for different projects.

## Should You Switch?

If you're currently using Arc and feeling frustrated by its future direction or Chromium foundation, now is an excellent time to give Zen Browser a try. With the addition of folders, most of the key features that made Arc special are now available in Zen, but with the added benefits of Firefox's privacy focus and open web commitment.

For Chrome users who never made the jump to Arc, Zen offers an even more compelling alternative. It provides the same innovative approach to tab management and user interface but without the baggage of Chromium's increasing restrictions.

## How to Try Zen Folders Today

If you're eager to experience the folders feature before it hits the stable release:

1. Download the [Twilight version](https://zen-browser.app/download?twilight) from the official website
2. Enable the "Folders" feature in about:config (search for "zen.tabs.folders.enabled")
3. Restart the browser

Note that as with any beta feature, there might be occasional bugs or performance issues. If you prefer stability, the feature should be available in the stable release by the end of August 2025.

## Conclusion

Zen Browser continues to evolve at an impressive pace, maintaining its focus on providing a calm, productive browsing experience while introducing meaningful innovations. The addition of folders addresses one of the few remaining features that Arc users might have missed after switching.

As browser technologies continue to advance, it's refreshing to see the Zen team prioritizing user experience and privacy over flashy but ultimately distracting features. With its Firefox foundation and thoughtful design approach, Zen Browser is positioning itself as the browser of choice for those who value both innovation and focus in their digital tools.
