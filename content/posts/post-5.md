Although nowadays, careers related to computer science are highly sought after, I must admit that it was not at all my initial ambition. Yet, the winding path that led me to become a software tester is a beautiful testament to the power of curiosity and perseverance.

From a very young age, I have always been a passionate and curious child about everything. Each new toy quickly became an object of thorough investigation. I wanted to understand how it worked, what were its mechanisms. Very often, my parents would find me in the middle of disassembled pieces, which I rarely put back together, by the way.

This exploratory fiber never left me, whether at school, at work or in life in general. I liked to question things, to try to understand the ins and outs. When I discovered the world of computing and software, it was an almost true revelation.

At first, it was just a simple hobby for me. I explored the different programs, operating systems, out of pure curiosity. But very quickly, I realized that my meticulous nature and my "sharp" eye for detecting the slightest anomalies represented a real asset. After many detours and a lot of luck, I started to seriously consider the profession of software tester. A field that perfectly combines my thirst for understanding and my eye for detail. Each new application, each update became a stimulating challenge: dissecting the code, reproducing all possible scenarios, identifying potential bugs or failures. 

Over time and experience, I have learned to master the different testing techniques and methodologies. From unit tests to integration tests to performance and security tests, no aspect escapes my heightened vigilance. Well, that's what I would like to tell you, but it would be lying, those three areas are currently completely unknown to me. I can't wait to learn, but currently my skills are "limited" to End2End testing, manual testing, automated testing, exploratory testing as well as overall test management. The most fun, in my opinion, is wanting to "break" the platform we're testing, not out of spite towards the dev who worked on it, but out of respect. By putting the code to the test, I put it at the center, I look at it from as many angles as possible, with the ultimate goal of perfecting it.

But beyond the technical skills, this profession has also taught me the value of communication and teamwork. As a tester, I am the essential interface between developers and end users. My role is to ensure that the product is not only functional, but also user-friendly and accessible to all.

Thus, from this childlike curiosity was born a true passion for quality. Every day, I contribute to making applications more robust, more reliable and more enjoyable to use. And even if the path has been long and winding, I am proud to have followed the meanders of my exploratory nature all the way to this really fun career.

Curiosity, that spark that animates us from the earliest age, can lead us down unsuspected paths. All you have to do is cultivate it, nurture it, and channel it into a job that becomes a hobby.
