Ten years ago, I left [ETML-ES](http://etml.ch/formation/es/informatique-de-gestion) with my diploma in hand, and last June 25th, I had the chance to go back in time by returning to my old school. It was nice to see the places and meet the final year students.

As I prepared for my presentation, I wondered how I could talk about myself while also talking about them. A difficult exercise, because I must admit that I was never a huge fan of academic learning, and I was far from being the best student in the class. Even worse: I haven't coded in years and I practice a profession that wasn't even mentioned during my studies. So, drawing from these past 10 years, I tried to propose a "cheat sheet", a crib sheet, that could help them avoid the missteps I made.

[ETML-ES](http://etml.ch/formation/es/informatique-de-gestion) (Business IT School), in Lausanne offers comprehensive training in business computing, and I am proud to have followed this course. I have been able to use and still use the skills I acquired at school to navigate in my field.
During my presentation, I talked about my journey, my current work as a Test Manager (hello [QoQa](https://qoqa.ch) ðŸ˜‰), and gave some advice (from an old timer) to the students for their future career. I don't have all the answers, nor have I launched a rocket into space, but if you have the opportunity, don't hesitate to go back to your old school to share your experiences with the current students. It reminds us that time passes, and that in addition to good training, sometimes a little luck and a helping hand can put us in the right place in life.

This visit, although short, placed an idea in my mind like "Inception": if I were given the opportunity to teach courses, would I accept it? **Surely**.

Upon further reflection, I realized why the idea of teaching courses appeals to me so much. Firstly, I enjoy speaking in public and sharing my knowledge with others. Secondly, I have a strong desire to give back and pass on what I've learned throughout my career. Thirdly, teaching is something I've always wanted to try, and it's still on my bucket list. Lastly, I'm always looking for new challenges and experiences, and teaching would certainly provide that opportunity.
