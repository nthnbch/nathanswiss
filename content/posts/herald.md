**TL;DR**: Discovering your family’s coat of arms is more than a fun curiosity, especially in Vaud, Switzerland. The Cantonal Archives hold heraldic treasures that can reconnect you with centuries of identity, history, and belonging.

# When Ancient Symbols Became Personal: My Family's Heraldry Journey

A few years ago, if someone had told me I'd have my family's coat of arms tattooed on my body, I probably would have laughed. Yet here I am today, proudly wearing these ancient symbols that represent centuries of family history.

It’s amazing how a simple visit to the Vaud Cantonal Archives turned into a life changing journey of discovery.

## The Day Everything Changed

It started with simple curiosity. Walking into the Vaud Cantonal Archives, I had no idea I was about to uncover treasures that would profoundly impact my sense of identity.

There, amid centuries old documents and registers, I found them, the coats of arms of both sides of my family.

The moment I saw these heraldic symbols, something clicked. These weren’t just decorative shields. They were the visual signatures of my ancestors, carrying stories across generations.

## Two Families, Two Stories

What makes my discovery particularly special is that I found both family crests, each one rooted in a different era, with its own language of symbols.

The first coat of arms, dating back roughly to the 19th century, is set on a deep blue field. At the top shines a white five pointed star, and below rests a white fleur de lys, the two separated by a striking red wavy division.

In heraldry, blue evokes loyalty and truth, while the star speaks of guidance and aspiration, a sign of hope carried forward. The fleur de lys, timeless and noble, suggests honor, tradition, and a link to the cultural heritage of the region. The red wave between them feels almost like a boundary of time or place, a reminder that identity is shaped by both continuity and change.

The second coat of arms is far older, reaching back to around the 14th century. It stands on a black field, bearing in golden yellow a millstone, then an anille, and finally a bar beneath them.

This shield feels medieval in the deepest sense, grounded, austere, enduring. The millstone is a powerful emblem of labor, sustenance, and the essential work of rural life, the kind of symbol that ties a family to the land and to the community’s survival.

The anille, a rarer charge in heraldry, is traditionally associated with milling and craftsmanship. It is the iron piece at the heart of a millstone’s mechanism, symbolizing technical skill, structure, and the hidden core that makes everything turn.

And the golden bar, one of the oldest heraldic charges, suggests protection, stability, and the steady weight of inheritance.

Together, these two crests tell different stories, one more recent and emblematic, the other ancient and deeply rooted in the soil of Vaud.

## From Archive to Skin: Making History Personal

After discovering these symbols, I knew I wanted to carry them with me always.

The decision to get them tattooed wasn’t just about aesthetics. It was about making history personal. These weren’t abstract designs anymore. They were mine.

Now, these ancient marks have become a daily reminder of where I come from, who I am, and the legacy I’m part of.

## Sharing the Legacy with My Children

One of the most rewarding aspects of this journey has been sharing it with my children.

Their eyes light up when I explain what each symbol means, why our ancestors chose these specific elements, and how these designs have been passed down through generations.

It has become a tangible way to teach them about heritage, making history feel real rather than distant.

## Beyond the Symbols: Diving into Genealogy

Finding our family crests sparked something bigger, an intense desire to know more about the people behind these symbols.

This led me down the fascinating path of genealogical research, where I discovered:

Family lines reaching back to the 14th century  
Ancestors whose lives were shaped by the rhythms of rural Vaud  
Deep connections to villages, valleys, and landscapes still familiar today  
Traditions of work, resilience, and community roles passed down silently  
Migration patterns within the canton across generations  

## The Archives: A Gateway to the Past

The Vaud Cantonal Archives proved invaluable in this journey.

Beyond heraldic records, I found:

Birth, marriage, and death registers going back centuries  
Property documents revealing where my family lived  
Occupational traces showing how they earned their lives  
Community records reflecting their place in local society  

It felt like opening a door into a world that had always been there, waiting.

## Understanding Our Origins

Through this research, I gained a deeper understanding of why my family settled where they did, what drove their choices, and how they contributed to their communities.

These discoveries helped explain:

Why certain family traditions exist  
How we came to live where we do today  
What historical currents shaped our path  
Why certain skills and values seem to echo across generations  

## A Living Legacy

Today, our family crests are more than historical artifacts.

They’re living symbols connecting past, present, and future. I’ve incorporated them into:

Family gatherings and storytelling  
Educational moments with my children  
Personal artwork and meaningful objects  
Conversations with relatives near and far  

## The Ripple Effect

What began as a simple search for family heraldry created ripples through our entire family.

It has:

Sparked conversations with distant relatives  
Revived forgotten stories  
Created new traditions  
Strengthened our sense of identity  
Inspired younger generations to explore their roots

This journey hasn’t ended. If anything, it’s only beginning.

Each discovery leads to new questions, new searches, and new connections.

In the end, what began as a curious visit to the archives became something far greater, a bridge between centuries.

These symbols, now etched into my skin, are not just decoration. They are identity. Memory. Continuity.

And perhaps the most beautiful part is this:

Every family has a story.
