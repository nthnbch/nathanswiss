Some jobs are easy to leave. And then there are those where every day teaches you something, where the team is brilliant, funny, professional, where even barbecuing is part of the culture. Leaving that? Not so easy.

I spent 7 incredible years at QoQa, learning, growing, failing, trying again—always with this wild freedom to explore, to break things (sometimes on purpose), and yes, to grill. I had the chance to work with truly talented people. I’m deeply grateful for that.

But sometimes, the urge to explore new ground becomes stronger. To jump into the unknown. To start fresh. And when that “something new” is called *Retraites Populaires*… well, let’s just say the scenery changes a bit.

Switching from fast-paced e-commerce to the world of pensions and insurance? That’s one heck of a leap. But to my surprise, many things are actually similar. The commitment to doing things right. The value of good ideas. The possibility to shake things up—gently, respectfully, and with a bit of mischief.

You can leave a great job thinking you’ll never find that magic again. And maybe you won’t. But the truth is: you take a piece of that magic with you. You plant it elsewhere. You rebuild. You evolve.

So thank you, QoQa, for the adventure, the freedom, and the grilled meat. And thank you, Retraites Populaires, for giving me the chance to come in and gently blow things up (efficiently, with a smile). You probably haven’t realized *exactly* what kind of person you hired yet... but that’s part of the fun 😄

Change isn’t always easy. But it’s always a good way to grow. And laughter—well, that should be non-negotiable, everywhere.
