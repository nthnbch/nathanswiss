 I’m Nathan

Helvetic rider, *heraldry enthusiast*, **Test Manager** by day, blindtest king by night.  
Part-time *geek*, **full-time dad** — and proud **côte de bœuf grillmaster**.

Here you'll find my social links, a short [bio](https://nathan.swiss/about), and a few [thoughts](https://nathan.swiss/posts) I’ve shared along the way.
