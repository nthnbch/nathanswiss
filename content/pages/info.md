Based in Lausanne, Iâ€™m a Test Manager with 8+ years in QA, ensuring websites and apps truly work.  
I **built the QA department at QoQa.ch from scratch**, shaping processes and mindset.  

Testing is about curiosity, common sense, and collaboration. Most of what I know, I learned hands-on, working with devs and stakeholders **having quality in mind**.  

Outside work, I read compulsively, ride my bike, enjoy good food, hazy beers, and great conversations. Whatever I do, I aim to make things a little better every day.
