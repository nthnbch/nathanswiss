Based in Lausanne, I work as a **Test Manager**, making sure websites and applications work exactly as they should.  
With over 8 years of experience in QA, I’m known for being open-minded, and just the right amount of crazy.

Originally trained in IT management, I turned my passion into my profession:  
I love what I do, and I do what I love.

I had the opportunity to build the **Quality Assurance department from the ground up** at QoQa.ch, shaping both processes and mindset.


Testing requires a lot of common sense, curiosity, and self-learning, but above all, it’s a deeply human job.  
I learned most of it *on the job*, by working closely with developers, stakeholders, and teams, building trust and collaboration to push toward a shared ideal: **quality**.

Outside of work, I read compulsively, enjoy good food, hazy beers, and great conversation.  
Whether professionally or personally, I try to make things better every single day.
