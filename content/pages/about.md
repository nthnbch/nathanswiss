# TL;DR: i test stuff.

Based in Lausanne ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡­, as a Test Manager, my role is to ensure that websites and applications function as they should. With over 8 years of experience in the QA field, I am known for being open and a bit crazy.

I am a trained IT management technician who has turned my passion into my profession: I do what I love and love what I do. I have had and still have the chance to build a Quality Assurance department from scratch at the company I worked for.

Testing involved applying a lot of common sense, self-training, as I learned my job "on the job," but above all, working closely with the development team and shareholders so that we all work towards an ideal of quality.

I read a lot, appreciate good food, drink hazy beers and like interesting people.
Whether in my professional or personal life, I strive to improve things daily.
