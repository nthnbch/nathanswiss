Based in Lausanne üá®üá≠, I work at <a href="https://www.qoqa.ch/fr/concept">QoQa</a>, a company fueled by fun and craziness. As a <strong>Test Manager</strong>, my role is to ensure that websites and applications function as they should. With 7 years of experience in the QA field, I am known for being open, a bit crazy, and efficient in my work.

I am a trained IT management technician who has turned my passion into my profession: I do what I love and love what I do. I have had and still have the chance to build a Quality Assurance department from scratch at the company I work for.

Starting almost from zero, I am particularly proud to say that QoQa now has a high standard of quality. The work involved applying a lot of common sense, self-training, as I learned my job "on the job," but above all, working closely with the development team so that we all work towards an ideal of quality. Most of the credit goes to this amazing team! ‚ô•Ô∏è

Whether in my professional or personal life, I strive to improve things daily. Proud dad, proud husband, crazy otter.
