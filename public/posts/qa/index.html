      <p>Although nowadays, careers related to computer science are highly sought after, I must admit that it was not at all my initial ambition. Yet, the winding path that led me to become a software tester is a beautiful testament to the power of curiosity and perseverance.</p>
<p>From a very young age, I have always been a passionate and curious child about everything. Each new toy quickly became an object of thorough investigation. I wanted to understand how it worked, what were its mechanisms. Very often, my parents would find me in the middle of disassembled pieces, which I rarely put back together, by the way.</p>
<p>This exploratory fiber never left me, whether at school, at work or in life in general. I liked to question things, to try to understand the ins and outs. When I discovered the world of computing and software, it was an almost true revelation.</p>
<p>At first, it was just a simple hobby for me. I explored the different programs, operating systems, out of pure curiosity. But very quickly, I realized that my meticulous nature and my &ldquo;sharp&rdquo; eye for detecting the slightest anomalies represented a real asset. After many detours and a lot of luck, I started to seriously consider the profession of software tester. A field that perfectly combines my thirst for understanding and my eye for detail. Each new application, each update became a stimulating challenge: dissecting the code, reproducing all possible scenarios, identifying potential bugs or failures.</p>
<p>Over time and experience, I have learned to master the different testing techniques and methodologies. From unit tests to integration tests to performance and security tests, no aspect escapes my heightened vigilance. Well, that&rsquo;s what I would like to tell you, but it would be lying, those three areas are currently completely unknown to me. I can&rsquo;t wait to learn, but currently my skills are &ldquo;limited&rdquo; to End2End testing, manual testing, automated testing, exploratory testing as well as overall test management. The most fun, in my opinion, is wanting to &ldquo;break&rdquo; the platform we&rsquo;re testing, not out of spite towards the dev who worked on it, but out of respect. By putting the code to the test, I put it at the center, I look at it from as many angles as possible, with the ultimate goal of perfecting it.</p>
<p>But beyond the technical skills, this profession has also taught me the value of communication and teamwork. As a tester, I am the essential interface between developers and end users. My role is to ensure that the product is not only functional, but also user-friendly and accessible to all.</p>
<p>Thus, from this childlike curiosity was born a true passion for quality. Every day, I contribute to making applications more robust, more reliable and more enjoyable to use. And even if the path has been long and winding, I am proud to have followed the meanders of my exploratory nature all the way to this really fun career.</p>
<p>Curiosity, that spark that animates us from the earliest age, can lead us down unsuspected paths. All you have to do is cultivate it, nurture it, and channel it into a job that becomes a hobby.</p>
