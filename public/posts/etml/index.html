      <h1>Back to school</h1>
      
    </div>
    <div class="content">
      <p>Ten years ago, I left <a href="http://etml.ch/formation/es/informatique-de-gestion">ETML-ES</a> with my diploma in hand, and last June 25th, I had the chance to go back in time by returning to my old school. It was nice to see the places and meet the final year students.</p>
<p>As I prepared for my presentation, I wondered how I could talk about myself while also talking about them. A difficult exercise, because I must admit that I was never a huge fan of academic learning, and I was far from being the best student in the class. Even worse: I haven&rsquo;t coded in years and I practice a profession that wasn&rsquo;t even mentioned during my studies. So, drawing from these past 10 years, I tried to propose a &ldquo;cheat sheet&rdquo;, a crib sheet, that could help them avoid the missteps I made.</p>
<p><a href="http://etml.ch/formation/es/informatique-de-gestion">ETML-ES</a> (Business IT School), in Lausanne offers comprehensive training in business computing, and I am proud to have followed this course. I have been able to use and still use the skills I acquired at school to navigate in my field.
During my presentation, I talked about my journey, my current work as a Test Manager (hello <a href="https://qoqa.ch">QoQa</a> 😉), and gave some advice (from an old timer) to the students for their future career. I don&rsquo;t have all the answers, nor have I launched a rocket into space, but if you have the opportunity, don&rsquo;t hesitate to go back to your old school to share your experiences with the current students. It reminds us that time passes, and that in addition to good training, sometimes a little luck and a helping hand can put us in the right place in life.</p>
<p>This visit, although short, placed an idea in my mind like &ldquo;Inception&rdquo;: if I were given the opportunity to teach courses, would I accept it? <strong>I would surely think about it</strong> (like Fedde le Grand).</p>
<p>Upon further reflection, I realized why the idea of teaching courses appeals to me so much. Firstly, I enjoy speaking in public and sharing my knowledge with others. Secondly, I have a strong desire to give back and pass on what I&rsquo;ve learned throughout my career. Thirdly, teaching is something I&rsquo;ve always wanted to try, and it&rsquo;s still on my bucket list. Lastly, I&rsquo;m always looking for new challenges and experiences, and teaching would certainly provide that opportunity.</p>
