      <description>TL;DR: i test stuff. Based in Lausanne ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡­, as a Test Manager, my role is to ensure that websites and applications function as they should. With over 8 years of experience in the QA field, I am known for being open and a bit crazy.&#xA;I am a trained IT management technician who has turned my passion into my profession: I do what I love and love what I do. I have had and still have the chance to build a Quality Assurance department from scratch at the company I worked for.</description>
